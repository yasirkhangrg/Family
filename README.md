Family Relationships in Prolog
📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to represent and query family relationships using Prolog, a logic programming language. It defines basic family facts (like parent-child relationships) and builds more complex relationships such as siblings, grandparents, ancestors, and descendants using logical rules.

The program showcases how knowledge representation and inference work in Prolog.

📂 Project Structure
The project consists of a single Prolog file containing:

Facts → Basic relationships and gender definitions
Rules → Logical definitions to derive new relationships
📊 Defined Facts
The following base facts are included:

Parent Relationships
Tom is the parent of Bob and Liz
Bob is the parent of Ann and Pat
Pat is the parent of Jim
Gender Information
Males: Tom, Bob, Pat, Jim
Females: Liz, Ann
⚙️ Rules Implemented
1. Father
Defines a father as a male parent.

father(X, Y) :- parent(X, Y), male(X).
2. Mother
Defines a mother as a female parent.

mother(X, Y) :- parent(X, Y), female(X).
3. Grandparent
Defines a grandparent through an intermediate parent.

grandparent(X, Y) :- parent(X, Z), parent(Z, Y).
4. Sibling
Defines siblings as individuals sharing the same parent.

sibling(X, Y) :- parent(Z, X), parent(Z, Y), X \= Y.
5. Ancestor
Defines ancestors recursively.

ancestor(X, Y) :- parent(X, Y).
ancestor(X, Y) :- parent(X, Z), ancestor(Z, Y).
6. Descendant
Defines descendants using the ancestor relationship.

descendant(X, Y) :- ancestor(Y, X).
▶️ Sample Queries
You can run the following queries in a Prolog interpreter:

Find Bob’s children:
?- parent(bob, X).
Find Tom’s grandchildren:
?- grandparent(tom, X).
Find siblings of Ann:
?- sibling(ann, X).
Check if Tom is an ancestor of Jim:
?- ancestor(tom, jim).
Find descendants of Bob:
?- descendant(X, bob).
🎯 Learning Outcomes
Understanding of logic programming concepts
Use of facts and rules in Prolog
Implementation of recursive relationships
Querying knowledge bases effectively
🔗 Tools Required
Prolog Interpreter (e.g., SWI-Prolog)
📌 Conclusion
This project provides a simple yet powerful demonstration of how family relationships can be modeled using logical rules. It highlights the strength of Prolog in handling relational data and recursive queries.
